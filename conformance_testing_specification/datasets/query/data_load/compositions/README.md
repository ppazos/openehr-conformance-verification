# COMPOSITION data for testing queries

This folder contains data to commit different COMPOSITIONs, with known data, to different EHRs, to be able to specify "expected results" for the queries in the QUERY test data sets.

We have COMPOSITIONs for these OPTs that already exist as part of the Robot test data sets:

  1. minimal_admin.opt
  2. minimal_observation.opt
  3. minimal_instruction.opt
  4. minimal_evaluation.opt

We don't have yet samples for minimal_action.opt because the commit for that COMPOSITIONs fails on the server (see https://jira.vitagroup.ag/browse/EHR-537)
